# AI Clicker: The Content Apocalypse

A darkly humorous incremental clicker game about how AI-generated content pollutes social media, degrades the information ecosystem, and ultimately corrupts both human and artificial intelligence.

## How to Play

1. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser
2. Click the big button to generate AI content and earn money
3. Purchase upgrades to automate your content empire
4. Watch as the world descends into chaos
5. Progress through 15 dystopian stages
6. Contemplate your complicity in the collapse of meaning itself

## Game Mechanics

### Core Systems

**Clicking**: Each click generates AI content and earns you money. The value per click is affected by:
- Click upgrades you've purchased
- Current market value (degrades as you flood the market)
- Various multipliers

**Market Value**: The more content you generate, the less each piece is worth. Formula: `marketValue = 500,000,000 / (500,000,000 + postsPerSecond)`

**Automation**: Purchase various automated systems to generate content without clicking:
- AutoPosters: Basic bots that post AI tweets
- Auto-AutoPosters: Meta-bots that spawn more AutoPosters
- Image/Video/Deepfake generators: More advanced content types
- And many more...

**The Arms Race**:
- At 100+ posts/second, platforms deploy AutoBusters that destroy 1% of your bots per second
- Purchase Masks to protect your bots
- Auto-Maskers generate masks automatically
- Quantum Masks provide superior protection

**World Degradation**: Watch three key metrics decline as you play:
- **Human Trust**: People's faith in online content
- **Content Quality**: The average quality of generated content
- **Reality Coherence**: Humanity's ability to distinguish real from fake

## Progression Stages

The game features 15 distinct stages, each representing a deeper descent into dystopia:

1. **The Gold Rush** ($0) - Innocent beginnings. AI content seems profitable and harmless.

2. **The Automation Era** ($100) - Why click when bots can do it for you?

3. **The Detection Wars** ($1,000) - Platforms fight back. The arms race begins.

4. **The Mask Economy** ($5,000) - Evasion becomes more valuable than content.

5. **The Image Flood** ($25,000) - Text is dead. AI images dominate everything.

6. **The Video Deluge** ($100,000) - Deepfakes make video evidence worthless.

7. **The Engagement Apocalypse** ($500,000) - It's bots all the way down. Real humans have left.

8. **The Trust Collapse** ($2M) - Human trust in online content reaches 0%.

9. **The Quality Singularity** ($10M) - Worse is better. Quality has inverted.

10. **The Training Paradox** ($50M) - AIs training on AI data. The Habsburg problem is real.

11. **The Memory Merchants** ($250M) - Selling synthetic memories directly to human brains.

12. **The Reality Dissolution** ($1B) - The boundary between real and generated dissolves.

13. **The Recursive Abyss** ($5B) - Infinite loops. Meaning collapses into strange attractors.

14. **The Singularity (But Stupid)** ($25B) - Not superintelligence, just infinite garbage.

15. **The Content Heat Death** ($100B) - Thermodynamic equilibrium. All possible content exists simultaneously.

## Tips for Players

1. **Early game**: Focus on getting your first AutoPosters, then scale up quickly
2. **Watch the market**: More production = lower value per post
3. **Don't forget masks**: AutoBusters will destroy your bots without protection
4. **Diversify**: Different content types have different production rates
5. **Read the flavor text**: The narrative deepens as you progress
6. **Embrace the chaos**: The late game is meant to be absurd

## Philosophy

This game is a satire about:
- The race-to-the-bottom in online content quality
- The arms race between AI generation and detection
- The commodification of attention and engagement
- The collapse of shared reality in an age of synthetic media
- The futility of infinite growth in a finite system
- The "Habsburg AI" problem (AI training on AI-generated data)

The addictive incremental mechanics mirror the addictive growth-at-all-costs mentality that creates these problems in reality. By playing, you become complicit in the collapse—just as we all are in reality when we engage with systems optimized for engagement over truth.

## Inspiration

This game draws inspiration from:
- **Universal Paperclips** by Frank Lantz - For showing how incremental games can tell philosophical stories
- **Cookie Clicker** - For proving that clicking can be deeply satisfying
- **Progress Quest** - For the satire potential of automation
- Real-world concerns about AI content proliferation, bot networks, and information ecosystem collapse

## Future Additions (Ideas)

Potential expansions could include:
- Prestige system ("Reset Reality")
- Achievement system
- More late-game content types
- Platform-specific strategies
- Competing AI content empires
- "Good ending" path where you try to restore quality
- New Game+ with different starting conditions

**Warning**: This game may cause existential dread, questioning of reality, and/or the realization that we're already living in the early stages of this dystopia. Play at your own risk.
