- **Watch the world degrade**: The three metrics show the consequences of your actions
- **Embrace exponential growth**: Numbers will get absurdly large
- **Save frequently**: Game auto-saves every 5 seconds, but you can manually save too

## Understanding the UI

### Top Display
- **Money**: Your current funds
- **$/second**: Your production rate
- **Market Value**: How much your content is worth (decreases with volume)

### Left Sidebar (Upgrades)
- Shows available upgrades
- Grayed out = can't afford yet
- Click to purchase
- Some upgrades have purchase limits

### Center (Main Game)
- **Big button**: Click to generate content
- **Stage display**: Current stage and description
- **AI content samples**: Occasionally shows "generated" content

### Right Sidebar (Stats)
- **Production stats**: Total posts, posts/sec, total clicks
- **Automation stats**: AutoPosters count, masks, survival rate
- **World state**: Human trust, content quality, reality coherence
- **Controls**: Save, export, import, reset

### Bottom (News Ticker)
- Shows current events related to your progress
- Updates every 15 seconds
- Stage-specific messages

## The Narrative Arc

**Stages 1-3**: The innocent beginning. AI content seems profitable.

**Stages 4-6**: The arms race. Platforms fight back. Trust begins to erode.

**Stages 7-9**: The collapse. Real humans leave. Quality inverts.

**Stages 10-12**: Reality breakdown. AIs train on AI data. Memories become synthetic.

**Stages 13-15**: The abyss. Recursion, singularity, heat death. The end of meaning.

## Advanced Strategies

### Early Game
- Focus on AutoPosters first
- Get Auto-AutoPosters as soon as possible ($1,000)
- Don't neglect click upgrades early on

### Mid Game
- Balance automation with defense (masks)
- Diversify into Image and Video generators
- Get Click Farms for the 10% production multiplier

### Late Game
- Focus on high-value automation (Training Rigs, Memory Synthesizers)
- Multipliers become more important than raw production
- Read all the flavor text - the narrative gets wild

### Endgame
- Recursion Engines and Singularity Nodes are extremely powerful
- The Heat Death upgrade is the "win condition"
- Reflect on what you've done

## Troubleshooting

**Game won't load**: Make sure JavaScript is enabled in your browser.

**Save data lost**: The game uses LocalStorage. Clearing browser data will erase saves.

**Game running slow**: Shouldn't happen, but try refreshing the page. The code is optimized for efficiency.

**Numbers too big**: That's intentional! The game supports up to trillions.

**Nothing to click**: By late game, automation does everything. Watch the dystopia unfold.

## Sharing Your Progress

1. Click "Export Save" button
2. Your save data is copied to clipboard
3. Paste it somewhere safe or share with friends

### Import Save
1. Click "Import Save" button
2. Paste save data into the text box
3. Click "Import"

## Offline Progress

The game calculates up to 24 hours of offline progress when you return. Your automation keeps working even when the tab is closed!

## Reset

If you want to start over:
1. Click "Reset Game" button
2. Confirm twice (it's permanent!)
3. Game reloads with fresh state

## Philosophy

This isn't just a clicker game - it's a commentary on:
- AI content proliferation
- The degradation of online discourse
- The attention economy
- The collapse of shared reality
- The futility of infinite growth

By making it fun and addictive, the game makes you complicit in the collapse. Just like in reality.

## Have Fun!

Or don't. By the end, you might not be sure what "fun" means anymore.
